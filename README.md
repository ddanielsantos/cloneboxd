### What is Cloneboxd?

Cloneboxd it's a web application based on Letterboxd, you can expect the same functionalities and some more if I stop procastinating. This project was my first Rest API and at the start of 2022 I tought that would be a good idea to ressurrect it and implement what I'm studying at the moment.
